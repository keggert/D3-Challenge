          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty and Obesity</h3>
          <p>Based on our graph, we can see positive correlation between poverty and obesity, but there are some data points that 
            may not completely show the relationships. One thing to mention is that based on lifestyles, states like Hawaii, Massachusetts,
            and Colorado have a lower percentage of obesity than a state like Virginia that has a similar percentage of poverty due to people
            having healthier lifestyles and potentially more outdoor spaces to exercise. We do have a few outliers. It is not just about poverty and obesity,
            I also believe the region where a state is located and the population of that state could also explain differences between states with similary poverty 
            rates but different obesity rates.
          </p>
          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Age (Median) and Healthcare</h3>
          <p>
            I was curious about the correlation between age and healthcare. One thing to note is that the ages listed are from 26-52.
            I wonder if some of this might be because the Affordable Care Act covers adults until the age of 26. Based on our graphs, there is 
            no correlation between age and healthcare. It appears that states with a lower median age are more likely to have a higher rate of lacking
            healthcare but it is hard to infer based on our data. The relationship between age and healthcare can be better explained by other factors
            such as poverty or household income. Whether or not a person has healthcare is determined more by their income level and poverty, not age.
